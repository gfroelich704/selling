### Notes:
- Ensure that the **deposit network** on the receiving wallet matches the withdrawal network on OKX (e.g., TRON (TRC20)). Otherwise, your funds may be lost.
- If your phone number, email, and authenticator app are linked, only email and app verification will be required for withdrawals.

2. **Enter Transfer Details:**  
   Select the transfer channel (e.g., phone number, email, UID, or sub-account). Input the recipient details and the **USDT amount**, then click **"Next"**.

3. **Verify and Confirm:**

### Tip: Tag Information
For certain cryptocurrencies (e.g., XRP), you must include a **tag** along with the address. This numeric tag ensures the funds are routed correctly. Without it, your funds may be lost.
