## Overview of Tether

Tether, initially named Realcoin, was launched in 2014 by Reeve Collins, Craig Sellars, and Brock Pierce. The USDT token is issued by Tether Limited, a company controlled by Bitfinex, which allows redemption at a 1:1 ratio with fiat currency.

While Tether was originally built on the Bitcoin blockchain, it has since expanded to operate on over a dozen different blockchain protocols, including [Ethereum (ETH)](https://bit.ly/OKXe), [Tron (TRX)](https://bit.ly/OKXe), and [Solana (SOL)](https://bit.ly/OKXe).

Tether was launched on the Omni layer, a platform for creating and trading assets on the Bitcoin network. However, it is now most commonly used on the Ethereum blockchain, where it facilitates faster and lower-cost transactions.

## The Evolution of USDT

### 1. Asset Backing
Initially, Tether stated that USDT was fully backed by US dollar deposits. However, Tether later revealed that its reserves also include cash equivalents, short-term deposits, commercial paper, government securities, corporate bonds, and other investments.

### 2. Record-Breaking Minting
In January 2021, Tether minted 2 billion USDT tokens within a single week, driven by surging interest in cryptocurrencies. This growth coincided with an increasing lack of trust in traditional financial systems and rising institutional interest in crypto.

### 3. Expansion Across Blockchains
- **Avalanche (2021):** Tether launched on the Avalanche blockchain, enabling faster and cheaper USDT transactions.
- **Kusama (2022):** USDT became available on the Kusama network, a decentralized blockchain closely related to Polkadot.
- **Polygon (2022):** Tether launched on Polygon, an Ethereum layer-2 solution known for lower fees and faster transactions. Polygon had already processed over $1.6 billion in transactions and hosted over 19,000 decentralized applications (DApps).

## USDT Price and Economic Model

Tether Limited Inc. mints new USDT tokens in exchange for fiat deposits and burns tokens when users redeem them for fiat. This process ensures a stable supply of USDT.

**Key Details:**
- Circulating supply: 69.36 billion USDT.
- Total supply: 69.1 billion USDT.

Tether does not have a supply cap, allowing the creation of new tokens as long as sufficient collateral backs them. Issuing or destroying tokens does not affect their value due to the stable reserve backing.
