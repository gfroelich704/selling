## Understanding Blockchain Infrastructure and Gas Fees

For newcomers to the crypto world, grasping the fundamentals of blockchain infrastructure and transaction fees (Gas fees) is key to navigating and understanding more complex concepts. Below is a breakdown of how blockchain operates and why Gas fees exist.

### Public Blockchains and DApps: The Basics
- **Public Blockchains**: The underlying technology where transactions are recorded. Think of it as the Android operating system for smartphones.
- **DApps (Decentralized Applications)**: These are apps built on public blockchains, similar to how apps like WeChat or TikTok function on mobile systems.
- Every transaction on a blockchain requires resources, which translates into paying miners or validators a fee, commonly known as Gas fees.

### Gas Fees: A Necessary Fuel for Transactions
Gas fees compensate miners for the computational power required to process and record blockchain transactions. Much like paying for fuel to drive a car, these fees ensure smooth operations on the network.

#### How Gas Fees Are Calculated:
- **Gas Fee = Gas Price Ã— Gas Limit**  
  Gas Price represents the per-unit fee, while Gas Limit is the transaction complexity. This model incentivizes miners to prioritize higher-paying transactions, making them faster.

## Ethereumâ€™s EIP-1559 and Other Blockchain Fee Models

Ethereum introduced EIP-1559, a protocol that replaced the auction-based fee model with a transparent, fixed pricing system. Here's how it works:
1. **Base Fee**: A fixed fee determined by the networkâ€™s demand.
2. **Tip Option**: Users can add a small tip to accelerate transaction processing.

This system improves transparency and fairness, and similar models have been adopted by blockchains like Polygon and Avalanche. However, fee structures differ across blockchains, depending on their native tokens and network efficiency.

### Comparison of Blockchain Fee Models
- **Ethereum**: High decentralization but expensive Gas fees due to its native ETH tokenâ€™s high value.
- **OKTC (OKX Chain)**: Maintains the traditional Gas price Ã— Gas limit model, offering low fees and high speed.
- **BSC and Avalanche**: Use EIP-1559-like models with optional token-burning mechanisms.
